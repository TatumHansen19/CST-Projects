# üöÄ Deployment Guide - Complete Walkthrough

Deploy your Sentiment Analyzer to the cloud using **free tiers**!

---

## üìã Deployment Strategy

**Important:** Vercel does NOT support Python backends. We'll deploy in two parts:

1. **Backend (Python/FastAPI)** ‚Üí Choose ONE:
   - **Option A: Render.com** (Recommended - easier)
   - **Option B: Railway.app** (Faster, but requires credit card)

2. **Frontend (React)** ‚Üí **Vercel** (Best for React apps)

**Total time:** 30-45 minutes

---

## ü§î Which Backend Platform Should I Choose?

### Platform Comparison

| Feature | Render.com | Railway.app |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Free Tier** | ‚úÖ 750 hrs/month | ‚úÖ $5 credit/month |
| **Credit Card Required** | ‚ùå No | ‚ö†Ô∏è Yes |
| **Sleep After Inactivity** | ‚úÖ Yes (15 min) | ‚úÖ Yes (varies) |
| **Wake-up Time** | 30-60 seconds | 10-20 seconds |
| **Setup Difficulty** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Easy | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium |
| **Build Time (First)** | 10-15 min | 5-10 min |
| **Best For** | Beginners, no credit card | Faster performance |

### üí° Recommendation

**Choose Render** if:
- ‚úÖ You don't have a credit card
- ‚úÖ This is your first deployment
- ‚úÖ You prefer easier setup

**Choose Railway** if:
- ‚úÖ You have a credit card
- ‚úÖ You want faster wake-up times
- ‚úÖ You're comfortable with slightly more complex setup

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**‚ùå "Build failed" on Render/Railway**

**Problem:** Dependencies won't install

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check requirements.txt has all dependencies
# Make sure Root Directory is set to "backend"
# Verify Python version compatibility (3.8+)
```

**Check the build logs** for specific error messages.

---

**‚ùå "Application failed to respond"**

**Problem:** Server won't start

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Verify Start Command is correct:
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

# Check main.py is in backend/ directory
# Look for error in deployment logs
```

---

**‚ùå "Model download timeout"**

**Problem:** First deployment times out

**Solution:**
- This is normal! The model is 250MB
- Render: Takes 10-15 minutes first time
- Railway: Takes 5-10 minutes first time
- Be patient, watch the logs
- Subsequent deploys are MUCH faster (2-3 min)

---

**‚ùå Backend URL shows 404**

**Problem:** Wrong URL or service not running

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check the URL is correct (no typos)
# Make sure service shows "Active" in dashboard
# Try the /health endpoint first
# Wait 30-60 seconds (might be waking up)
```

---

### Frontend Issues

**‚ùå "Vercel build failed"**

**Problem:** Build process errors

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check Root Directory is set to "frontend"
# Verify Build Command: npm run build
# Check Output Directory: dist
# Look at build logs for specific error
```

---

**‚ùå "API Disconnected" error**

**Problem:** Frontend can't reach backend

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check VITE_API_URL is set correctly
# Verify URL has NO trailing slash
# Make sure backend is deployed and running
# Test backend /health endpoint directly
# Redeploy frontend after adding env var
```

---

**‚ùå Environment variable not working**

**Problem:** VITE_API_URL not being used

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Variables must start with VITE_
# Must add BEFORE first deployment, or redeploy after
# Check spelling: VITE_API_URL (all caps)
# Verify value has no quotes
# No trailing slash in URL
```

---

### Connection Issues

**‚ùå CORS errors in browser console**

**Problem:** Backend blocking frontend requests

**Solution:**
```python
# Check backend/main.py CORS config:
allow_origins=[
    "http://localhost:3000",
    "https://*.vercel.app",  # This should allow all Vercel
    "*"  # Or allow all (less secure)
]
```

Already configured correctly in the starter code!

---

**‚ùå "Backend sleeping" / slow first request**

**Problem:** Free tier sleeps after inactivity

**Solution:**
- This is NORMAL on free tier
- First request takes 30-60 seconds
- Subsequent requests are fast
- Use UptimeRobot to keep awake (see above)
- Or upgrade to paid plan

---

**‚ùå App works locally but not deployed**

**Problem:** Environment differences

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check environment variables are set
# Verify backend URL is production URL (not localhost)
# Test backend independently: /health endpoint
# Check browser console for errors (F12)
# Try in incognito/private mode
```

---

### Testing Individual Parts

**Test Backend Alone:**
```
# Health check
https://your-backend-url.com/health

# API docs
https://your-backend-url.com/docs

# Try POST /analyze from docs page
```

**Test Frontend Alone:**
```
# Run locally but use production backend
# Edit frontend/.env:
VITE_API_URL=https://your-production-backend.com

# Then: npm run dev
```

## üí° Common Questions

**Q: Why two different platforms?**
A: Vercel is great for React but doesn't support Python. Render/Railway are great for Python but not as good for React.

**Q: Can I use just one platform?**
A: Technically yes (Render can do both), but it's not ideal. Vercel is much better for React frontends.

**Q: Which is better, Render or Railway?**
A: Render = easier, no credit card. Railway = faster, requires credit card. Both work great!

**Q: Why does my backend sleep?**
A: Free tiers save resources by sleeping after inactivity. This is normal! Paid plans don't sleep.

**Q: Can I use this in my portfolio?**
A: YES! That's the point. Share your live URL proudly.

**Q: What if I hit free tier limits?**
A: Very unlikely for a class project. If you do, upgrade is ~$7-12/month total.
