## Key Learning Concepts

### React Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Components & Props**
   - Each component is self-contained
   - Props flow from parent to child
   - Example: `<ResultsSection result={result} />`

2. **State Management**
   - `useState` for local state
   - State updates trigger re-renders
   - Example: Loading states, results

3. **Effects & Side Effects**
   - `useEffect` for API calls
   - Component lifecycle
   - Example: Loading examples on mount

4. **Event Handling**
   - User interactions (buttons, input)
   - Async operations
   - Example: Analyze button click

5. **Conditional Rendering**
   - Show/hide components based on state
   - Example: Results only show after analysis

### API Integration

1. **Axios/Fetch**
   - Making HTTP requests
   - Handling responses
   - Error handling

2. **RESTful Endpoints**
   - GET, POST methods
   - Request/response format
   - Status codes

3. **CORS**
   - Cross-origin requests
   - Backend configuration
   - Security considerations

### Modern Web Development

1. **Vite Build Tool**
   - Fast dev server
   - Hot module replacement
   - Production builds

2. **Tailwind CSS**
   - Utility-first styling
   - Responsive design
   - Component styling

3. **Git Workflow**
   - Fork, clone, commit, push
   - Version control
   - Collaboration

## Common Student Issues & Solutions

### Setup Issues

**"npm install fails"**
```bash
# Clear cache and retry
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**"Python dependencies won't install"**
```bash
# Use virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**"Model download takes forever"**
- First time downloads ~250MB model
- Takes 5-10 minutes on slow connection
- Subsequent runs are fast

### Development Issues

**"Changes not showing up"**
- Save the file
- Check for syntax errors in terminal
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**"Port already in use"**
```bash
# Use different port
npm run dev -- --port 3001
```

**"CORS errors"**
- Already configured in backend
- Check browser console for specific error
- Verify backend is running

### Deployment Issues

**"Vercel build fails"**
- Check root directory is set to "frontend"
- Verify all dependencies in package.json
- Check build command is correct

**"Backend deployment times out"**
- First deployment takes 10-15 minutes
- Model download is the bottleneck
- Be patient, show students the logs

**"API not connecting after deployment"**
- Check VITE_API_URL environment variable
- Verify no trailing slash in URL
- Wait for backend to wake up (free tier sleeps)

## Teaching Tips

### Before Class
1. **Test everything yourself** - Deploy once before assigning
2. **Prepare accounts** - Have instructions for creating accounts
3. **Check internet** - Downloading dependencies requires good connection
4. **Have backup plan** - Pre-downloaded dependencies if internet fails

### During Class
1. **Live demo first** - Show it working before students start
2. **Explain architecture** - Don't assume they understand full-stack
3. **Walk through one modification** - Do an example together
4. **Encourage exploration** - Let them break things safely
5. **Pair programming** - Have students help each other

### Common Questions
- "What is React?" - See React explanation in main README
- "Why two servers?" - Frontend (UI) + Backend (AI logic)
- "What's an API?" - Explain REST and HTTP
- "Why does backend sleep?" - Free tier limitations
- "Can I use this in my portfolio?" - YES! Encourage it

## Extension Ideas

### For Advanced Students
1. Add authentication (Auth0, Firebase)
2. Database integration (store history)
3. Real-time updates (WebSockets)
4. Mobile app version (React Native)
5. Compare multiple AI models
6. Add visualization dashboard
7. Multi-language support
8. Social sharing features

### For Research Projects
1. Fine-tune model on custom data
2. Compare different transformer models
3. Analyze model bias
4. Build dataset of movie reviews
5. Create sentiment trend analysis
6. Implement active learning
